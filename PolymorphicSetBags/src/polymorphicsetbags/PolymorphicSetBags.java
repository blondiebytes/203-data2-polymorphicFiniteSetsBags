public class PolymorphicSetBags {

    
    // REQUIREMENTS: 
   
   // A finite bag is also called a mulitset and is like a set, 
   // but each element may occur many times. 
    
   // Your bags should be polymorphic, i.e. use generics to allow 
   // any kind of contents. 
  // By "pure", we mean that operations on the set return new sets and 
  // do not modify the old set. 
    
    
    // TO DO: 
    // FIRST CREATE TESTING HMMMMPH. Property-based testing!
    // USE self-balancing binary search tree
    // Design API for bags; need for Iteration
    // Match Up code with tests
    // Write paper
    
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO code application logic here
